# matplotlib-challenge
In this example of Matplotlib, we did an analysis for a (pseudo) company called Pymaceuticals. We received data about a study in which ten different drugs were tested as potential treatments for skin cancer. In the study, 250 mice were given drug treatments over 45 days. Their physiological responses were monitored over that time including tumor volume size, metastatic site spread and survival rates.

For my analysis, I used **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**, and a little bit of **SciPy** to perform statistical analysis and chart the changes. 

1. I parsed the CSV data into dataframes to calculate mean tumor volume, metastatic site spread and survival rates. 
2. I then charted each of these data sets into line graphs, including standard error, to show which drugs seemed effective over time.
3. In addition, I charted the percent change in overall tumor volume in a bar graph to visually indicate which drugs  reduced overall tumor volume from start to finish.
4. I provided a written summary and recommendations based on which drugs seemed to perform well (or not) and in which physiological areas (tumor size, spread, or survival).
